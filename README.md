# Semantic Web Project

## Objective

Apps4gaps have asked you build an API that is available over HTTP. They have asked you to select any two of their datasets. The API should provide a single interface through which the two datasets can be queried together, in a way that makes sense. The Apps4gaps datasets are available at data.gov.ie. Apps4gaps will, however, let you use any openly available dataset that is of interest to Irish people, even ones not available on their site. Your code for the API should be made publicly available through GitHub.
