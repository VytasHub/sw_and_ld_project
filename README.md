# Semantic Web Project

## Parking in Galway
### Garrett Jordan

## Overview 

Provide an API to combine data from Galway City Council on car parks in Galway City, Parking Meters in Galway City and Blue Badge parking spots in Galway City. As car parks and parking areas are subject to change the API will allow not only the querying of existing data but also the addition of new data, the modification of the existing data and the deletion of obsolete data. The API calls will reflect the HTTP verbs used and will be self describing. The project is to be developed in such a way that the addition onf other towns/areas dos not break the existing API and can be achieved by adding another route eg URL/galway/ and URL/athlone/ etc.


## Data Used
### Datasets, Attribution & Licencing

The initial seed data for the project is contained in the raw_data folder and is as follows:

* CarParkingOpenData.geojson
* ParkingMetersOpenData.geojson
* BlueBadgeParkingOpenData.geojson
 
All data was obtained through the Irish Government [Open Data portal](http://data.gov.ie) and is freely available under its [Open Data Licence](https://data.gov.ie/licence). Licences for the individual files will be provided where available.


## Objective

Apps4gaps have asked you build an API that is available over HTTP. They have asked you to select any two of their datasets. The API should provide a single interface through which the two datasets can be queried together, in a way that makes sense. The Apps4gaps datasets are available at data.gov.ie. Apps4gaps will, however, let you use any openly available dataset that is of interest to Irish people, even ones not available on their site. Your code for the API should be made publicly available through GitHub.
